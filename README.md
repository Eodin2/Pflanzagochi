# Plant Tamaguchi (Working Title)

This repository contains a small game built with Godot Engine in the wake of [Ludem Dare](https://ldjam.com/) 46. 
The game's goal is to raise an indoor plant, not letting it dry out and making it survive for as long as possible. 

## Building
The game is built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) and as such to build it, the Engine Editor with the Mono extension is required. 
Simple select the `project.godot` file in the start up dialogue. After loading, simply press F5 to build and run the game.
